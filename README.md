# Opportunities First Academic Database

**CREATED:** 2016

**LANUGAGE:** Visual Basic for Applications

**STATUS:** IN PROGRESS

**OVERVIEW:** A local nonprofit running a WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act) program for youth aged 17-24 did not have a scheme for storing, retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing their clients' test scores to gauge the effectiveness of their educational programs.  Assessments included: the TABE (Test of Adult Basic Education) Locator and Survey, Official GED Practice tests, Official GED tests, OhioMeansJobs practice WorkKeys tests, and the official ACT WorkKeys tests. To address this need, I began developing a Microsoft Access tool that allowed for the entry and modificiation of student demographic and test score data and provided an interactive calendar to track scheduled GED tests.

**NEXT STEPS IN PROJECT:**
* Refactor and standardize variable names following completion of coding boot camp
* Possibly rewrite the program as a dynamic web application using the .NET framework and MS SQL Server to ensure better scaling and maintenance
* Add functionality to the "Help" buttons
* Determine the best location to modify existing test score data
* Finish the last section, "Data Analysis", by (1) writing queries to summarize student test scores with descriptive statistics, (2) creating graphs to display the statistics results, and (3) enabling users to perform inferential tests on the data
* Add column for student age and gender
* Add OGT (Ohio Graduation Test), ServSafe, Customer Service, and Hospitality tests as tables in the database and include them in the score entry form
* Create unit tests with sample data

#### MAIN SCREEN
The user chooses from among four different options: (1) modifying cohort information, (2) entering test score data, (3) viewing or creating upcoming test appointments with an interactive calendar, and (4) summarizing and analyzing test data at the individual student, cohort, or multiple cohort level. (Note: the "Data Analysis" option is not functional at this time.)
